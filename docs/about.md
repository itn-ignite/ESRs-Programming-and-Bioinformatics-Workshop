### Welcome!
The ESRs Programming and Bioinformatics Workshop was created after the first summer school of the [ITN-IGNITE](http://www.itn-ignite.eu/). This workshop provided all the ESRs to get a base knowledge that will allow them to accomplished all their objectives from their projects. Moreover, the other IGNITE schools can go further into details without the need to start from the basics. The workshop was held in [MedILS](http://www.medils.org/) Split, Croatia. All the material will be available online in this webpage for our ESRs and the general public. This includes all the material, exercises, useful links, and more.

**NOTE:** This workshop was designed, developed and organized entirely by the ESRs for the ESRs.
